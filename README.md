# UI-wireframe 👀
## ✔ What is a wireframe?
Wireframing is a crucial step in developing UI, or user interface. Wireframes are a simple, often black-and-white display of how page elements will look on a screen. It drives the UI that will lead the design.

Most of the time, wireframes include elements such as:
- Main, secondary, tertiary, footer and other site navigations
- Banners
- Blocks of copy
- Buttons and calls-to-action
- Image blocks or spaces
By establishing a wireframe, designing teams can outline how they expect a website or app to appear on certain devices, laying the groundwork for the final product and UX, or user experience
## ✔ Types of Wireframes
- **Hand-drawn or paper wireframes**
- **Digital wireframes**
    - **Low-fidelity (low-fi) wireframes**, or wireframes that represent elements but aren't clickable or actionable and;
    - **High-fidelity (high-fi) wireframes**, or wireframes that represent actions and that are interactive and clickable to display the UX journey. High-fi wireframes might align closer to mock-ups than low-fi wireframes

## Tips for Building Great Wireframes
### 1. Start with user research
Every project should start by asking: "Who is this for?"
### 2. Solve for the user
Your wireframe and design shouldn't just be a showcase of your creative skills. Instead, consider scenarios for your user personas: When they arrive at your website or app, what information is most valuable to them? What tasks are they trying to complete?
### 3. Make wireframes a collaborative process
Take into consideration of different points of views of team members.
### 4. Consider building agile
Make time throughout the process to share feedback with one another, and with the client, to make sure everyone's on the right track.
### 5. Maintain consistency
- Be clear about what you'll include, and what you won't.
- Fonts (keep limited and generic), muted or black-and-white colors, spacing, and button or conversion shapes should be consistent across every version and wireframe you cerate
### 6. Create a legend or index for sharing
Related to consistency, a legend or index of colors, fonts, spacing, shapes and elements can help ensure everyone knows what-represent-what in the wireframe, whether digital or on paper. For example, if colors are used minimally in the wireframe, identify when and why they're used. If buttons take a specific shape, make note of it.
### 7. Set a deadline
### 8. Avoid the weeds
It's easy to start thinking two, three, or 12 steps ahead when building a wireframe. Afterall, it's just one prototype for the rest of the experience, right? By staying focused on one screen at a time - and the essentials that screen needs to convey to the user - you'll end up a better experience as you connect the other pages or wireframes that lie ahead
### 9. Use color sparingly ... if at all
As mentioned above, color in wireframes is usually avoided. Because wireframes precede design, often no color is used because that isn't pertinent to the page architecture. Keep it as clean and simple as possible
### 10. Use real copy and ditch the lorem ipsum
Lorem ipsum, also known as place hilder copy, has been aroung the web for ages. And while it can be helpful in early stages of content planning, it shouldn't be part of the final wireframe deliverable or design concept. Plus, planning for the real content rather than using placeholders, ensures design elements align appropriately across devices and screens
### 11. Iterate your versions
In true agile methodology, there should be no fear of failure. everytime you go back to adjust something in the wireframe - whether from feedback or from recognizing a potential obstable to avoid - you should consider it a lesson. To keep those lessons fresh, iterate your versions and save copies of everything you do. This lets you and your team learn from where you've come and see how the wireframe has grown as you've learned more about the product, service, user, client and beyond
### 12. Get feedback from everyone
### 13. Share the final wireframe with your client or stakeholder
### 14. Test your wireframes
### 15. Apply what you’ve learned going forward
